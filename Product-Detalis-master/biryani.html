        <h4> <small>$</small>210.50 </h4>
        <p>Biryani is a super tasty dish that is very famous all over the world and is enjoyed by people all over the world. It's made with layers of yummy stuff like rice, meat, and spices. First, let's talk about the rice. We use special rice called basmati, which smells really good when it's cooked. We mix it with spices to make it extra tasty. Next, we have the meat. It could be chicken, lamb, or even goat. We marinate it in yogurt and spices like garlic, ginger, and chili. This makes the meat really soft and full of flavor. Now, we start layering everything in a big pot. We put down a layer of rice, then a layer of meat, and keep going until the pot is full. In between the layers, we add things like salth and other spices, fried onions, and fresh herbs like mint and coriander. Then, we cover the pot and cook everything together slowly. This lets all the flavors mix and makes the biryani taste really, really good. Biryani is often served with cool yogurt sauce called raita and spicy pickles. It's perfect for special occasions or just when you want something really yummy to eat. With its amazing taste and smell, biryani is a dish that everyone loves. It's a favorite in many households and brings people together over a delicious meal. it is one of the most highly demanded item that is on repeat everytime. People loves to order it again and again because of its delcious and spicy taste. Our prices are also reasonable that everyone can enjoys it.</p>
