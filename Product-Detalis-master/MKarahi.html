        <h3> Mutton Karahi</h3>
        <h4> <small>$</small>280.00 </h4>
        <p>Indulge in the delightful flavors of our mutton karahi, a beloved dish at our restaurant that promises a satisfying meal for all. Mutton karahi is a classic Pakistani dish that features tender mutton cooked with a blend of simple spices in a traditional karahi, or wok. To create this flavorful dish, we start by selecting the finest cuts of mutton, ensuring they are juicy and full of flavor. Our skilled chefs then cook the mutton in a karahi over high heat, allowing it to brown and develop a rich flavor. We add a mixture of basic spices like ginger, garlic, cumin, coriander, and chili powder, along with tomatoes and green chilies, which infuse the dish with a delicious aroma and taste. As the mutton cooks, the spices blend together, creating a mouthwatering sauce that coats each piece of meat. The mutton becomes tender and succulent, while the sauce develops a depth of flavor that is both comforting and satisfying. To finish off our mutton karahi, we garnish it with fresh cilantro and ginger, adding a pop of color and freshness to each bite. Served hot with a side of naan bread or steamed rice, our mutton karahi is the perfect choice for a hearty and delicious meal. Whether you're a fan of Pakistani cuisine or simply looking to try something new and flavorful, our mutton karahi is sure to please. Come and enoy the wonderful experience the irresistible taste of our signature dish at our restaurant today!</p>
